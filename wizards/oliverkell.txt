From Oliver Kell's Victory in Stock Trading:
1. Price is news
2. Don't trust your stocks, trust your stops
3. Discipline weighs ounces, regret weighs tons
4. Losers average losers
5. Price hurts, but size kills
6. Gap ups = street caught off guard
7. Bigger the base, the higher in space
8. Buy right, sit tight
9. It's better to be out and want in, than in and want out
10. Sell when you can, not when you have to
11. From failed moves come fast moves
12. Sell into strength, or you will sell into weakness
13. Take small losses, or you will take big losses
14. Buy the rumor, sell the news
15. Be a buyer when they are crying, and a seller when they are yelling
16. You can always buy it back
17. Sell margin into strength and equity into weakness
