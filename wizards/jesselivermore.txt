Jesse Livermore's Trading Rules:
1. Forget the tips - trade on your own terms
Chasing someone else's "hot pick" is a fast track to failure. Do your homework, build your edge, and make your own calls.
2. Ride the wave - follow the market, don't fight it
Livermore aligned himself with the trend. If the market is moving, move with it - not against it.
3. Pull the trigger with conviction
When your setup hits, act. Second-guessing means missed opportunities. Trust your process and go all in - strategically.
4. Kill losers quickly - no mercy
The fastest way to blow up your account? Holding onto hope. If a trade turns against you, get out and move on.
5. Let the winners work
Don't interrupt a trade that's doing its job. Big wins need time - so don't settle for scraps when the market offers a feast.
6. Tune out the noise - watch the price
Forget headlines and hype. Price action tells the real story. Follow the chart, not the chatter.
7. Know when to sit on your hands
No clear setup? Don't trade. Livermore waited for ideal conditions - and that's why he survived and thrived.
8. Trade turning points, not random spikes
He looked for key inflection points - where trends were born or died. That's where he made his money.
9. Quality over quantity
You don't need 20 trades a day - you need one great one. Wait for the trades that scream "go".
10. Protect your capital like it's your last dollar
Capital is your lifeline. Guard it. Without it, your strategy, discipline, and dreams mean nothing.
