None of this is financial advice.
Once a week I journal my thoughts about the markets to be able to come back to them and review later.

Most of the week I've been hearing people on CNBC talk about buying the dip and holding for the long term. These 'long term investors' were nowhere to be found in 2023 and 2024. This tells me that people have bought the recent top and are now trapped.
I think we might get some more bad news, be it tariffs or firing of the Fed Chair Powell, which might shake out markets and force people to sell.
The sentiment is really bad:
	CBOE 04/17/25:
	SPX + SPXW PUT/CALL RATIO: 1.36
	Fear and Greed Index: 20.94 [extreme fear]
Looking at positioning, large speculators sold ES and bought NQ. I'd say that 'AI AI AI' and Nasdaq-100 are probably going nowhere until people sell the dip they bought.
Overall, I think the markets are bottoming, and it might take some time.
But, as usual, nobody knows, and the bottom (APR 8th) could be in.
Most of the actively managed 'smart' ETFs are in risk off mode and long treasuries, which is also a good contrarian indicator.
Based on sentiment and positioning here, I am looking to go long ES and Bitcoin futures.
The moment the markets stop going down on the bad news is the moment I am going to pull the trigger on the trade.
