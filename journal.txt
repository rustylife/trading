None of this is financial advice.
Once a week I journal my thoughts about the markets to be able to come back to them and review later.

Most of the week I've been hearing people on CNBC talk about buying the dip and holding for the long term. These 'long term investors' were nowhere to be found in 2023 and 2024. This tells me that people have bought the recent top and are now trapped.
I think we might get some more bad news, be it tariffs or firing of the Fed Chair Powell, which might shake out markets and force people to sell.
The sentiment is really bad:
	CBOE 04/17/25:
	SPX + SPXW PUT/CALL RATIO: 1.36
	Fear and Greed Index: 20.94 [extreme fear]
Looking at positioning, large speculators sold ES and bought NQ. I'd say that 'AI AI AI' and Nasdaq-100 are probably going nowhere until people sell the dip they bought.
Overall, I think the markets are bottoming, and it might take some time.
But, as usual, nobody knows, and the bottom (APR 8th) could be in.
Most of the actively managed 'smart' ETFs are in risk off mode and long treasuries, which is also a good contrarian indicator.
Based on sentiment and positioning here, I am looking to go long ES and Bitcoin futures.
The moment the markets stop going down on the bad news is the moment I am going to pull the trigger on the trade.

So, on Monday, we had bonds, stocks, dollar down again. Usually one of them is up.
Now, what's interesting is that, despite all the bad news and uncertainty, the market kept going up for the rest of the week.
The positioning from CFTC COT report shows that large speculators sold ES, but bought NQ. While small speculators, the worst of traders, sold both.
What's the most painful and scary trade right now?
I'd say it is to go long here among this uncertainty.
Another fade indicator, Vasily Oleynik (Dengi ne spyat show) says that the trade war will continue, and that we should not be buying anything here.
Well, I am going to long ES futures when they start trading on Sunday evening with the stop-loss being the low of APR 8th.
I like Vasily, but I like making money more.

Despite the continued tariffs uncertainty, the market continues to go up every day.
People do not think this is a sustainable rally, and there are now recession concerns, because of negative GDP print.
It seems like people are looking to short this market, and people are definitely underinvested and reduced their risk exposure.
Looking at CFTC COT report/positioning, both large and small speculators sold ES/NQ and reduced their risk.
Another idea I keep hearing is that we're going to trade in a range, which, to me, strongly suggests we won't, and instead we'll pump straight to new all-time highs.
I remain long MES futures, only 1 contract, APR 27th entry, because my stop loss level is too wide, almost 700 points from the APR 7th bottom at 4830.
You ride her until she bucks you, or you don't ride at all.
