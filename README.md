# Mamkin Capital

We believe there are two things that work in the market: sentiment and positioning.

- Go long when everybody is short and bearish.

- Go short when everybody is long and bullish.

We analyze consensus and positioning based on CFTC COT, options, actively managed ETFs, and CNBC.

Fade, do not trade!

None of this is financial advice!
